## ðŸ›  Available Commands

```bash
# Start the application
npm run dev                    # âœ… Currently running

# Database operations
npm run db:studio             # Open database management GUI
npm run db:seed              # Refresh sample data
npm run db:migrate           # Apply schema changes
npm run db:migrate-from-firebase  # Import Firebase data

# Build and deploy
npm run build                # Build for production

```

## ðŸ”„ Migration Options

### Option 1: Pure Neon (Current Setting)
- Environment: `USE_NEON_DATABASE=true` âœ…
- Status: **Active and recommended**
- All operations use PostgreSQL

### Option 2: Hybrid Mode
- Environment: `USE_NEON_DATABASE=false`
- Uses Firebase with option to migrate data
- Good for testing and gradual transition

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Improvements

### Performance
- **Query Speed**: PostgreSQL offers better performance for complex queries
- **Indexing**: Optimized database indexes for faster searches
- **Joins**: Efficient relational queries across tables

### Data Integrity
- **ACID Compliance**: Full transaction support
- **Foreign Keys**: Enforced data relationships
- **Constraints**: Data validation at database level

### Scalability
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connections
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Better scaling options with Neon
- **Backup & Recovery**: Enterprise-grade data protection

### Security
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure, stateless authentication
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Prisma's query builder protection

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Test All Features**: Login and test patient management, appointments, billing
2. **Customize Settings**: Update clinic information in settings
3. **Import Production Data**: Use migration script for real data
4. **Deploy**: When ready, deploy to production with Neon

## ðŸ“± Application Features Working

Your application now supports:
- âœ… User authentication and role-based access
- âœ… Patient management with full profiles
- âœ… Appointment scheduling and management
- âœ… Treatment planning and tracking
