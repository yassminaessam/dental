| **Insurance** | InsuranceClaim, InsuranceProvider | Insurance processing |
| **Inventory** | InventoryItem, PurchaseOrder, PurchaseOrderItem, Supplier | Supply chain management |
| **Pharmacy** | Medication, Prescription, PrescriptionMedication | Medication management |
| **Communication** | Message | Patient communication |
| **Referrals** | Referral, Specialist | Healthcare network |
| **Portal** | PortalUser, SharedDocument | Patient portal |
| **Settings** | Staff, ClinicSettings | System configuration |

## 🛠 Available Commands

```bash
# Start the application
npm run dev                    # ✅ Currently running

# Database operations
npm run db:studio             # Open database management GUI
npm run db:seed              # Refresh sample data
npm run db:migrate           # Apply schema changes

```

## 🔄 Migration Options

### Option 1: Pure Neon (Current Setting)
- Environment: `USE_NEON_DATABASE=true` ✅
- Status: **Active and recommended**
- All operations use PostgreSQL

### Option 2: Hybrid Mode
- Environment: `USE_NEON_DATABASE=false`
- Uses Firebase with option to migrate data
- Good for testing and gradual transition

## 📈 Key Improvements

### Performance
- **Query Speed**: PostgreSQL offers better performance for complex queries
- **Indexing**: Optimized database indexes for faster searches
- **Joins**: Efficient relational queries across tables

### Data Integrity
- **ACID Compliance**: Full transaction support
- **Foreign Keys**: Enforced data relationships
- **Constraints**: Data validation at database level

### Scalability
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connections
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Better scaling options with Neon
- **Backup & Recovery**: Enterprise-grade data protection

### Security
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure, stateless authentication
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Prisma's query builder protection

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test All Features**: Login and test patient management, appointments, billing
2. **Customize Settings**: Update clinic information in settings
3. **Import Production Data**: Use migration script for real data
4. **Deploy**: When ready, deploy to production with Neon

-- Execute: neon-migration.sql
-- Creates: sessions, password_reset_tokens, file_storage tables
```

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables in Vercel
```bash
# Add these:
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-key-minimum-32-characters-long
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

# Remove Firebase variables (no longer needed):
# FIREBASE_API_KEY, FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN, etc.
```

### Step 3: Deploy
Your 100% Neon-powered system is ready for deployment!
